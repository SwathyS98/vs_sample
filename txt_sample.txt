#1. accept current change

#3. both

adding the changes          ---- git add .
check the history           ---- git log
commiting the code          ---- git commit -m "the name of the process"
pushing the code            ---- git push
now we want to check status ---- git status

--------------------branching-----------------------------
main part
when there is more than one employee in our firm, each employee will be given separate branches to push their work
and the main staff will pull these works to the main branch. So the next day these employees can pull from the 
main branch.for creating a new branch just click on main and then click on create new branch.This will make the flow of project more easy.
 
 -------------creating new branch----------------
 git checkout -b profile
 ---for pushing-------------git push origin profile
 ---for changing branch---git checkout -b profile
 ---for going back to main--git checkout main
 to pull from the brance profile---git pull origin profile , then click on sync
